- right now we support only star-shaped topology;
i.e.
 actors in main process can talk with anyone, and
 children in sub-processes can talk with actors in main process.

For the time being, it seems sufficient for what I want to do -> I do
not see the need to change it :)

- should test performance at some point - is this worth using on large scale?
